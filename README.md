# Password-Generator 

Password generator allows you to generate password of length of your choice and also stores the password alongwith the name defined by the user in a secured_pw.txt file loacted in the same place where the source code is, the file created in read-only so that, even if, user by mistake changes the file (:P Passwords are safe). It also gives authority to the user to delete the complete file containg password.
As soon as the password is generated the password gets copied to clipboard (copy-paste ready).

To run on your local machine clone the repo and have these files in order to activate drive functionality :

* client_secrets.json
* token.json
* setup.py
* quickstart.py

and then run

`pip install -r requirements.txt `


To save all the modules name in a file

`pip freeze > requirement.txt`
