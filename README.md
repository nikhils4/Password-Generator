# `Password-Generator`
> Generate password of length of your choice.

Password generator allows you to generate password of length of your choice. It stores the password along with the name defined by the user in a `secured_pw.txt` file. The file is read-only so you passwords can't be messed with. It also gives authority to the user to completely delete the file. Plus, the password gets copied directly to clipboard at your convenience!

## Run
1. To run on your local machine, first clone the repo.
1. Then make sure you have the 4 files listed below: 
    1. `client_secrets.json`
    1. `token.json`
    1. `setup.py`
    1. `quickstart.py`
1. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You are now all set to run the program!

#### Footnote
> **Tip** - *To save all the modules names in a file (for any python project), you can use the command `pip freeze > requirement.txt`*

Feedback is welcome!! :smile:
